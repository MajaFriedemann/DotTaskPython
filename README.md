# DotTaskPython
 
This experiment can be set to the dots task or the squircles task as perceptual decision-making tasks.
This is a "social" version where the participant sees a partner's response and confidence rating after reporting their own. 
This experiment can be set to be a non-strategic version where the participant simply observes the partner's responses, or to a strategic version where the decision reported with higher confidence will be taken as the joint decision based on whose accuracy the participant is rewarded at the end of the experiment. In the strategic version, objective feedback is provided on each trial as well as on average per block.
